## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The project follows a traditional client-side architecture with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files:

- **HTML Structure**: Single-page layout with semantic HTML5 elements and Bootstrap 5 components
- **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap 5 via CDN for responsive grid system and pre-built components
- **Custom Styling**: CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for consistent theming and maintainable styles
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript with DOM manipulation and event-driven programming patterns
- **Animation System**: CSS-based animations triggered by JavaScript for enhanced user experience

### Styling Strategy
The CSS architecture uses a combination of:
- Bootstrap 5's utility classes for rapid development
- CSS custom properties for theme consistency
- Custom utility classes for reusable styling patterns
- Component-specific styling with proper cascading

### JavaScript Architecture
The JavaScript follows a modular initialization pattern:
- Single entry point with DOMContentLoaded event listener
- Functional programming approach with separate initialization functions
- Event delegation and proper event listener management
